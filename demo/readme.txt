Files
-----
1) demo.js -> all the simulation scripts using limejs
2) graph.js -> all the graph object code
3) assets/grid2.png -> background image
4) compiled/demo.js -> compiled version of demo.js for portability
5) index.html -> main html page to drive the simulation
6) index-uncompiled.html -> main html page to drive the simulation, but doesn't use the compiled version of the code (must have closure library to utilize)
7) assets/instructions.png -> image for the instructions on the page

Demo.js was compiled using:

../repository/Working/My_Homework-5/Talbot-Christine-ITCS5230-Hwk5/bin/lime.py build demo -o compiled/demo.js
